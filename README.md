## 🎯 Problem Statement

To predict a student’s final performance score using Machine Learning based on the following features:

- Study hours per day  
- Attendance percentage  
- Previous exam score  

The output is displayed both as a **numeric score** and a **visual circular progress indicator**, making the prediction intuitive and user-friendly.
